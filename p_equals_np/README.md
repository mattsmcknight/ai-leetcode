# P vs NP: A Computational Exploration

## Overview

This project is a rigorous computational exploration of the P vs NP problem through
the lens of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem. It
implements formal definitions, multiple SAT solvers (from brute-force baseline to
creative experimental approaches), empirical scaling analysis tools, and a detailed
research analysis of findings.

The project implements six SAT solvers spanning four mathematical frameworks
(algebraic, spectral, geometric, structural), measures their runtime scaling on
hard random 3-SAT instances at the phase transition, and documents why each approach
fails to achieve polynomial time. The full test suite comprises 402 tests, all passing.

## Background

The P vs NP problem asks whether every decision problem whose solution can be
*verified* in polynomial time can also be *solved* in polynomial time.

- **P** is the class of problems solvable in time O(n^k) for some constant k.
- **NP** is the class of problems where a "yes" answer can be verified in polynomial
  time given a certificate (witness).

Since any problem solvable in polynomial time is trivially verifiable in polynomial
time, P is a subset of NP. Whether P equals NP or is a strict subset is the most
important open problem in theoretical computer science and one of the seven
Millennium Prize Problems.

**Why SAT?** Boolean Satisfiability was the first problem proven NP-complete
(Cook-Levin theorem, 1971). A polynomial-time SAT algorithm would immediately
imply P = NP. SAT is structurally simple, admits rich algebraic, geometric, and
graph-theoretic interpretations, and exhibits a sharp satisfiability phase transition
near clause-to-variable ratio 4.267 for 3-SAT, providing a natural source of hard
instances.

```python
from p_equals_np.sat_types import Variable, Literal, Clause, CNFFormula
from p_equals_np.sat_generator import (
    generate_random_ksat,
    generate_random_3sat_at_threshold,
    generate_satisfiable_instance,
    generate_unsatisfiable_instance,
    generate_structured_instance,
)

# Build a formula manually: (x1 OR ~x2) AND (~x1 OR x3)
x1, x2, x3 = Variable(1), Variable(2), Variable(3)
formula = CNFFormula((
    Clause((Literal(x1), Literal(x2, positive=False))),
    Clause((Literal(x1, positive=False), Literal(x3))),
))
print(formula)                    # CNFFormula((x1 | ~x2) & (~x1 | x3))
print(formula.num_variables)      # 3
print(formula.clause_variable_ratio)  # 0.666...

# Generate a random 3-SAT instance at the phase transition
hard_formula = generate_random_3sat_at_threshold(20, seed=42)
print(hard_formula.num_variables)  # 20
print(hard_formula.num_clauses)    # 85

## Results Summary

All six solvers exhibit exponential or worse scaling on hard random 3-SAT instances
at the phase transition. No solver achieves polynomial time on this class of instances.

| Solver         | Polynomial Component        | Exponential Component                   |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| BruteForce     | None                        | O(2^n * m) exhaustive enumeration       |
| DPLL           | Unit propagation, pruning   | O(2^n) worst case; 129x-2534x faster    |
| Algebraic      | Gaussian elimination O(n^3) | Groebner basis: EXPSPACE                |
| Spectral       | Eigenvalue computation O(n^3)| DPLL fallback: O(2^n)                  |
| LP Relaxation  | LP solve O(n^3.5)           | Rounding: no guarantee (~47% at threshold) |
| Structural     | 2-SAT/Horn-SAT O(n+m)      | General 3-SAT: no structural shortcut   |

Each approach illuminates a different facet of why SAT resists polynomial-time
solution:

- **Algebraic**: Degree explosion in Groebner basis mirrors the 2-SAT to 3-SAT jump.
- **Spectral**: Graph structure cannot encode literal polarities.
- **Geometric**: Continuous relaxation loses discrete combinatorial information.
- **Structural**: Hard instances have no tractable substructure (unbounded treewidth,
  no small backdoors).

For the full analysis including proof barrier discussion (relativization, natural
proofs, algebrization), see [ANALYSIS.md](ANALYSIS.md).

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (uses modern type hint syntax: `X | Y`, `list[int]`, etc.)
- **pytest** (for running the test suite)
- **Optional**: `numpy` (improves numerical stability in curve fitting)
- **Optional**: `matplotlib` (enables scaling plots; falls back to CSV without it)

No other external dependencies are required. All solvers, data types, and core
analysis tools are implemented in pure Python.

## Intellectual Honesty

**No polynomial-time SAT algorithm was found.** This was the expected outcome.

If P = NP, it would be the most significant result in the history of computer
science. The P vs NP problem has been open for over 50 years and has resisted the
efforts of Turing Award winners, Fields Medalists, and thousands of researchers.
Three major barrier results (relativization, natural proofs, algebrization)
constrain even the *type* of argument that could resolve it.

The value of this project lies not in the (correctly expected) failure to find a
polynomial-time SAT algorithm. It lies in the rigorous exploration of *why* each
approach fails:

- Every approach has a polynomial-time component that handles some tractable aspect
  of the problem efficiently.
- Every approach hits an exponential wall when confronted with hard 3-SAT instances
  at the phase transition.
- The failures are not accidents of implementation. They reflect structural barriers
  that are predicted by complexity theory.

The phase transition at clause-to-variable ratio ~4.267 is the empirical
manifestation of the P/NP boundary: the point where constraint density overwhelms
every known structural shortcut. Understanding this boundary -- through rigorous
implementation, measurement, and analysis -- is what this project contributes.

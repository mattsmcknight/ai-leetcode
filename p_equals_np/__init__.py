"""P=NP Research Exploration: rigorous computational investigation of P vs NP.

This package implements a structured exploration of the P vs NP problem
through the lens of Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete
problem established by the Cook-Levin theorem (1971).

The package provides:

- **Formal definitions**: Executable representations of decision problems,
  complexity classes (P, NP, NP-complete, NP-hard), polynomial-time
  reductions, and solver protocols.

- **SAT data types**: Immutable, memory-efficient representations of
  Boolean variables, literals, clauses, and CNF formulas with DIMACS
  serialization support.

- **Instance generators**: Random k-SAT (including at the phase transition
  threshold), planted satisfiable instances, guaranteed unsatisfiable
  instances, and structured instances from combinatorial problems.

- **Solvers**: Brute-force baseline (exponential), DPLL with unit
  propagation (exponential worst-case, practical pruning), and
  experimental polynomial-time attempts.

- **Complexity analysis**: Empirical runtime measurement and polynomial
  vs exponential scaling detection.

Intellectual honesty note:
    The honest expectation is that no polynomial-time SAT algorithm will
    be found. The value of this project lies in the rigor of the exploration
    and understanding WHY each approach fails to achieve polynomial time.
